What is a network?
A network allows devices to connect and communicate with each other, facilitating the sharing of information, resources, and services.

Client Server Model
For the Machine to be a server it should have a software in the server that serves information or data.
To access a server we need the ip_addr of the server and the PORT that the service is running on
to access it -> ip_addr:PORT
localhost -> 127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:8080

Http  : 80
Https : 443

DHCP:
It is a protocol that will assign IP to a device in the network.

DNS:
Name -> IP

MAC Address: physical addresss burnt into the nic of the device.

NIC: Network Interface Card
It is an adapter on the machine that allows it to communicate with the network
Older Nics:
3com Network interface card


Cable
RJ45 UTP Cable - (Rejistered Jack Untrusted pair cabling)
10 base2 or thin-net
10 base5 or thick-net
Modern option 10 baseT

SFP - Small form-factor pluggable

To connect a fiber cable to the device a SFP should be used on the NIC for the device
or Wifi approach is to use a Wifi adapter (thing with antennas)

MAC - Media Access Control
When the manufacturer creates the network interface card, they write the Mac address to the NIC
Writtern in hexa decimal (48 bit number)

So nic basically give us access to a network using copper fiber or Wifi
