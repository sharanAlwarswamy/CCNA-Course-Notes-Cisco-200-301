A network has a physical topology and a logical topology

**Bus Network**
~~~[ Image bus-topology-two-one]~~~

10 base 5
10 - 10 Mbps (Mega bits per second)
bit -> either 0 or 1
1 byte = 8 bits
base -> baseband means that only one signal can be sent across the cable at any time, so only one person could talk
5 -> 500 meters
2 -> 200 meters

Drop cable (aka. The third wheeler):
Is a device that would join the 10 base5 pyh cable connection between two devices to join the network
 
By the end of a bus network there will be a device called terminators that will cancel out signals and prevent them from echocing back to the network. esentially saving the network


**Star Network**
~~~[ Image star-topology-two-two]~~~
Hub in the middle and devices all around it 
Hub's total number of ports caps the total number of devices that can be in the network
Traffic received in one port is then flooded out to all of the other ports
also known as multi-port repeater

Before they send a signal they should sense if any traffic is there in the network, if there is, it should wait for a random amount of time before sensing again
CSMA - Carrier Sense multiple access collition detection

Uni-Cast (1 device talking to 1 device)
Broad-Cast (1 device talking to every device)
Multi-Cast (1 device talking to a group of devices)

Routers will not allow broadcast in them, it wont receive or sent broadcast signals

Starlink 
Satellites ➜ Dish ➜ Starlink Router ➜ Wi-Fi

Starlink Dish (Antenna): You install this outside (it’s called “Dishy”). It connects directly to the Starlink satellites in space.
Starlink Router: Comes with the kit. The dish connects to this router via cable.
Satellite Connection: The dish talks to satellites in low Earth orbit, which then relay data to ground stations connected to the internet.
Internet Access: The signal comes back to your router and gives Wi-Fi to your devices.

**Firewall**
It scanns and block incoming or outgoing traffic.

Inside a firewall there is 
- IDS Intrusion Detection System 
- IPS Intrusion Prevention System

Switch delivers POE to an AP
POE - Power over ethernet
AP  - Access Point

Installing Cisco Packet Tracer
Familiarizing the UI

WIC - WAN interface card
NIM - Network interface module
